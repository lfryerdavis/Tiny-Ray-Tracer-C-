# Tiny-Ray-Tracer
This will be frozen for now. I may switch back to it at a later time, but since my students are typically 
more interested in Python than C++ these days, I will be switching this project over to Python.

The project was never intended to be more than a proof-of-concept to illustrate to my grade 12 class,
so performance considerations are not an issue.
